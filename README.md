Both this paper and assignment were a little baffling for us. At a (very) high-level, the paper and concepts it discussed made sense, but when reading on and when discussing in class, we got bogged-down by the details.

For this assignment, we spent our whole time attempting to get HW 1.1 done. We broke off a bit trying to get two different sides of it working, as we thought this would be most efficient.
